# üöÄ AIOps Engineering Lab

This repository documents my journey building a **modular, real-time AIOps platform** integrating **DevOps, observability, and AI**.

## üìö Overview

This lab-based project is divided into weekly modules to cover core concepts of AIOps:
- Monitoring Stack (logs, metrics, dashboards)
- Log anomaly detection & classification
- AI-enhanced CI/CD workflows
- Kubernetes-based deployment automation
- Auto-remediation via ML/NLP models

## üìÜ Weekly Modules

| Week | Module | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | [Week1 - Monitoring Stack](./Week1 - Monitoring Stack) | Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Flask app |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | (Coming soon) Log Analyzer | Train and deploy AI models for log classification |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | (Planned) CI/CD Automation | GitHub Actions with AI-triggered decision points |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | (Planned) Kubernetes Infra | Helm-based K8s deployment of AIOps pipeline |
